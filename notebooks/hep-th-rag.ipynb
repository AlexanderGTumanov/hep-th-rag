    "The high-energy theoretical physics (hep-th) literature is exceptionally dense. Papers are packed with highly specialized terminology, domain-specific conventions and abbreviations, as well as long chains of tightly coupled ideas, often extending far beyond the brief summary given by the abstract. As a result, search approaches that rely primarily on titles, abstracts, or keyword matching have significant limitations: they often miss relevant work entirely, or find papers whose abstract appears related but whose substantive content is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem becomes especially acute when the goal is not merely to identify relevant papers, but to locate where within those papers a given concept, construction, or argument is discussed. In hep-th, crucial ideas are frequently introduced deep inside a section, developed across several paragraphs, and never explicitly restated in the abstract. A search system that cannot look beyond abstracts is therefore fundamentally constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a semantic search engine for the hep-th arXiv that enables fast, meaning-aware search over the full text of papers, returning not only the most relevant papers but the specific sections or passages that best match a given query. Rather than treating each paper as a single unit, the system operates at the level of text chunks, which allows for fine-grained retrieval of relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we constructed a large-scale corpus spanning five years of hep-th submissions, from 2021 to 2025, including cross-listed papers and totaling over 36,000 documents. Each paper was carefully processed to remove mathematical expressions and LaTeX artifacts that are not useful for semantic retrieval, such as equations, citations, references, figures, code blocks, and custom macros. The result is a cleaned textual representation that preserves the conceptual structure of the papers while eliminating noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed corpus, comprising approximately 1.6 GB of cleaned text, was divided into text segments, for a total of roughly 850,000 chunks. A custom word-level vocabulary of approximately 43,000 tokens was built from this corpus, and each chunk was encoded accordingly. Using this representation, a transformer-based encoder model was trained to map text chunks into a dense vector space. Given a natural-language prompt, the model produces an embedding that can be rapidly compared against the corpus to identify the most semantically relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is a system capable of scanning a large body of highly technical literature and locating precise, contextually relevant sections within papers, rather than relying on coarse metadata or shallow keyword matches. This notebook documents the construction, training, and evaluation of that retrieval component, which can serve as the foundation for more advanced retrieval-augmented projects in the future.\n",

However, applying this retrieval method directly to the full corpus is inefficient, since most papers can be filtered out as irrelevant using much faster techniques. One such technique is TF–IDF lexical similarity search, which is extremely fast and can quickly narrow the corpus down to a set of lexically relevant chunks. At that stage, the encoder neural network can be used to rerank these candidates based on deeper semantic context."

Three optional arguments, `pool_level`, `top_k_chunks`, and `top_k_sections`, control this aggregation step. The `pool_level` argument determines whether aggregation happens at the paper level directly, or whether chunks are first pooled into section scores and then pooled across sections.

The problem is that `2112.10569` dropped noticeably in the ranking. This behavior is typical for dense retrievers.

    "In this project we developed a domain-specific retrieval system for high energy theory papers that combines fast lexical filtering with neural semantic reranking. The work covered the full pipeline, from processing raw arXiv sources to training the encoder and evaluating hybrid ranking strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A substantial part of the project was devoted to building a robust preprocessing pipeline for the original LaTeX sources. This involved stripping commands, resolving custom macros, and removing other LaTeX artifacts to produce a clean text corpus. This step proved essential for stable training, as it removes a large amount of noise from the data and prevents the model from picking up meaningless patterns from raw LaTeX code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural component is based on a standard double-encoder architecture trained with a cross-entropy objective. Queries and chunks are embedded independently, and the model is trained to assign higher similarity to correct pairs within each batch. From a practical standpoint, it is useful to train the model at a shorter context length, where optimization is faster and more stable. The encoder can then be adapted to a longer context length at retrieval time, allowing it to process longer chunks without retraining the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the retrieval side, the experiments confirm a consistent pattern. A simple TF–IDF lexical search, which ranks documents based on direct term overlap with the query, performs extremely well for highly specific prompts that contain distinctive vocabulary. Dense reranking, in contrast, captures broader semantic relations and can surface relevant papers that lexical search ranks low. However, pure dense reranking can disturb papers that are already correctly placed near the top. Hybrid strategies that combine lexical and dense signals provide more stable results, with Reciprocal Rank Fusion offering the most robust behavior across different prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project demonstrates a practical hybrid retrieval pipeline, along with a complete data-cleaning and training setup that can be adapted to other arXiv categories.\n"
